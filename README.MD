# XIAO RP2040 MALICIOUS DRIVE #

Hello guys, I go by the name Fernandez, but you can call me CyberInkuei 🥷😎.
This project is a BAD USB simulation built to showcase how simple-looking devices can become powerful tools for security testing, awareness, and defense.

The BAD USB functions as an Human Interface Device(HID), capable of executing keyboards strokes on a computer in seconds, but usually programmed for malicious purposes. We will be making use of the XIAO RP2040 chip for our bad usb project. You can purchase one here: <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html?srsltid=AfmBOop0VZ_jHX3hqeEwixS7_KCj41w8qmIfnBCEUeNWxq647FOvcWkS">SeedStudio</a> or <a href="https://www.microscale.net/?srsltid=AfmBOoooYjyeR2MXf-PNIm0P0SWP6HJNdi7z7AktNsc88h1k5MQf68Tw">Microscale</a> if you're in Nigeria.
