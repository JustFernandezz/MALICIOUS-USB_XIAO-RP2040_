# XIAO RP2040 MALICIOUS DRIVE #

Hello guys, I go by the name Fernandez, but you can call me CyberInkuei 🥷😎.
This project is a BAD USB simulation built to showcase how simple-looking devices can become powerful tools for security testing, awareness, and defense.

The Bad USB functions as a Human Interface Device (HID), allowing it to emulate a keyboard and execute keystrokes on a computer within seconds. While this capability is often abused for malicious purposes, it also makes Bad USB devices valuable tools for security research, awareness, and attack simulation.

For this project, we’ll be using the XIAO RP2040 microcontroller as the foundation of our Bad USB build. You can purchase the board from
